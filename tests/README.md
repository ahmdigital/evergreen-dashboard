# Unit Testing
We use the Jest JavaScript Testing Framework for writing tests, for more information see https://jestjs.io/ .

## Running the Test Suite
To run the test suites use the command:
```
npm test
```
To get coverage testing info in a tabulated format use the command:
```
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Test Cases
Currently tests are included for:
* semantic versioning functions
* configuration parameters types and values

This can be improved on in the future to test components and rendering.
